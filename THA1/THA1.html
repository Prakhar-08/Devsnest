      <p><i>Respected Sir, </i></p>
      <p>
        This letter is to inform you about the devsnest's 30 day training program.
        This program helps the students to learn in a responsive environment where they can
        grow individualy as well as a group. The program includes some of the best handpicked
        questions that have been asked in FANG interviews and other companies as well. The program
        focuses on a strong DSA foundation and also provides a development environment for the students to make
        mistakes and learn together. Please schedule a meeting so that we can take the talk further.<br><br>
        Hoping for your response.
        <br>
     </p>
     <p>
       Your's Sincerely <br>
       Prakhar Rastogi <br>
       Student
